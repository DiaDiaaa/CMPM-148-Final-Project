- There are many stories hidden in this small town. Mermaid Song, Death Ballad, Inheriting Personality. Many people may feel that their life is perfect, with a wonderful family and a wonderful job. Or maybe some people feel that their lives are terrible, being betrayed, or families split. But what they don't know is that the whole of this world is just a script in the hands of others.

 Jennifer: Nothing special. # CLASS: Jennifer
 
 Hearing what she said, you slowly relaxed. Although she didn't know it, your hand was on the alert button all the time.

- You are tremble when you saw her with a sneaky smirk on her face.

 * Creakâ€¦ The door shutted.

- You sat down slowly and carefully at the chair, and the chilly perspiration on your back soaked your clothes. Every meeting you have with her makes you uneasy and afraid, fear has gripped every nerve in your body. Yet you are a psychologist, and you have to take it all.

[Commercial Center]

- You walked to a nearby commercial center after leaving the clinic. Today is still business as usual. Barely see anyone along the way. Despite the fact that almost every company is closed, several businesses insist on staying open.
 
  You was strolling down the street when You noticed a store called "Home of Soul," and your curiosity compelled you to go inside.
 
 * [Enter the store]
 
- You walked into the store and took a look around. The shop is small, but it sells a variety of unusual products such as tributes, sculptures, dream nets, and much more stuff that you cannot name.

  After a bit, an old man with glasses emerged from the entrance.

  Old man: Welcome to Home of Soul. What would you like to get? Young man. # CLASS: oldMan

- Old man: Let me see, you can take two things from my shop today, the usage of which may change your destiny, but you will also pay something with a cost that you cannot see. Will you still be interested in purchasing it? # CLASS: oldMan

  The old man's words puzzled me. What does he mean by the cost that I cannot see? I don't understand and am stubbed. Yet I choose to buy things nonetheless.

 * Jeff: I would like to purchase some. What do you have for purchase? # CLASS: Jeff

[Psychiatric institution]

- You left your clinic and proceeded to the city's largest psychiatric institution.

  You used to work here, but the environment was so dreary that You quit and decided to create your own clinic.

  For some reason, you felt like someone was guiding you here, and you came to this place again.

 * [Walk into the Psychiatric institution]
 
- The nurse at the front desk recognized you right away.
 
  Nurse: Hi! Doctor Jeff, What brings you here? # CLASS: nurse

 * Jeff: Ohh, Hi! Nothing. I'm just looking around here. What have you been busy with recently?  # CLASS: Jeff

- Nurse: She's in building 44, room 44. Please, Doctor Jeff. # CLASS: nurse

 * [Go to building 44, room 44]
 
- As You got closer and closer to the enigmatic woman, you could sense a suffocating atmosphere creeping up on me. You was standing in front of the door of Room 44, and the awful atmosphere had totally swallowed me up as if a pair of chilly hands had gripped your throat and taken your breath away.

 * [Knock on the door]
 
- Jeff: Good afternoon, I am Dr. Jeff. May I come in? # CLASS: Jeff

  As You thought, the whole room was separated by a glass wall, so You could have a very safe conversation with her.

 * Jeff: Ma'am, How have you been? # CLASS: Jeff

- The old lady: Aha, what do I smell? It's the smell of death. # CLASS: oldLady

  The old lady: Young man, you're gonna die! # CLASS: oldLady

- Jeff: Ma'am, I wonder to know, why do you say I'm gonna die? And how do you know? # CLASS: Jeff

  The old lady: Reason? You should figure it out by yourself, young man. # CLASS: oldLady

  A villainous smile on her shriveled face.
  
  The old lady: Oh yes, young man. # CLASS: oldLady

  She raised her arm and pointed at me.

  The old lady: Jeff, right? Come over here! I have something good for you. # CLASS: oldLady

  She holds a stack of poker and a grin spreads across her face.

  The old lady: I have a set of Tarot, maybe they will tell you the reason. # CLASS: oldLady
  
 * Playing games with mental patients that is not too much is also a good treatment for them.

- Jeff: Yes, Ma'am. What's the rule? # CLASS: Jeff

  The old lady chuckled.

- You opened the DSM-5, which lists several typical forms of mental disorders.

 * [Depression] -> depression
 * [Bipolar Disorder] -> bipolar_disorder
 * [Close DSM-5] -> close_dsm5
 
== DID
- Dissociative Identity Disorder (as known as DID):
  There will most certainly be one or more substantial identities with their own past in the patient's mental world. They can usually speak with their primary identity and gain control of their body, although some patients are not aware of this. There is another personality in their body, resulting in the "missing time" phenomenon.
  
 * [Back] -> mental_disorders_list

== depression
- Depression: 
  Individuals with depression are frequently unpleasant and depressed for a long time, and even severe patients exhibit world-weariness, negativity, and strong suicidal impulses. The majority of patients are depressed as a result of overwhelming external pressure. They must take medicine for an extended period of time and insist on seeing a psychiatrist improve their health.

 * [Back] -> mental_disorders_list
 
== bipolar_disorder
- Bipolar Disorder:
  Patients with bipolar disorder typically encounter both mania and depression. The disorder's etiology is unclear, however, it is frequently associated with external factors such as chronic stress and early trauma. This sort of patient is often hyperactive, sleep duration is severely shortened, and severe individuals have suicidal impulses.

        You've completely lost control of yourself. Your left and right faces are distorted and utterly incorrect, your left face's eyes are insane, and your tongue is protruding out of your mouth. Your right face, on the other hand, is terribly depressed. The right eye appears to have recently sobbed, and the corner of the lips is fully down, obviously miserable.

    - Sanity > -10 && Sanity <= 0:

        You appear fatigued today, with black bags under your eyes. You may need to take a break.

        You appeared more energetic today, and despite your beard, you are still fairly refreshing.

- You have no idea that she will come to see me again, but you have a bad feeling about her state. 
- Your hands start to sweat, you feel nervous, and you already put your hand on the button of the alarm. You are glad that you had the Anesthesia needle ready in advance and put it in your pocket, just in case.


- Jeff: Nice to see you, Ms. Jennifer, now let's start our routine inquiry. # CLASS: Jeff

 * Jeff: Did you dream about something last night? # CLASS: Jeff
     
- Jennifer: Last night, I had a dream that several of the chains on the man seemed to be broken, and he could stand up. What is the meaning behind it? I wonder know. # CLASS: Jennifer

-

 * Jeff: What did you eat yesterday? # CLASS: Jeff

- Every nerve in your body got tightened as she took over the knife. Your hand was already in the trouser pocket, clutching your anesthetic needle, ready to sedate her at any moment.

- Jennifer: This knife does not look to be very comfortable. It is considerably weaker to the one I previously used. # CLASS: Jennifer

* You're slightly relieved that she has no tendency to hurt anyone, but the chilly perspiration has soaked your back.

- Jeff: Ms. Jennifer, your current condition is critical. I will provide you with medication right now. # CLASS: Jeff

 * [The Hidden drawer] 
 
-  Found a strong medicine in a red bottle.

 * [Leave]
 
- Just as you were about to stand up, you felt your shoulders being held down, and you tried so hard to stand up, but didn't move. This is not a strength a woman can have.

- Jennifer: Tell me, Dr. Jeff, this drug won't kill me, will it? # CLASS: Jennifer

* Not at all, Ms. Jennifer. It's just a wonder drug. # CLASS: Jeff

- Jennifer: Ohh, really? Dr. Jeff, you better not deceive me, cause no one in this world can be able to afford the consequences, including you. # CLASS: Jennifer

-
    * Tell her the truth: The medicine here has significant adverse effects, and you may vomit after taking it, but the impact is excellent. # CLASS: Jeff

- Then, Jennifer leaves the room.

- You slumped to the ground, and what had just happened seemed to suffocate me over and over again. You wanted to get out of here before she came back.

- [Day 3]

- You awoke drowsily from your bed and struggled to get out of it. Today's condition isn't great, but your head is swollen like a balloon, it hurts somewhat, and your entire body is incredibly weak. It might have been somewhat due to the woman from yesterday, but you still have to go to the clinic today.

 * [Take a few bites of breakfast and head to work]
 
 - As usual, when you arrive at the clinic, you make yourself a cup of freshly brewed espresso. You're sitting on your chair, quietly staring at Newton's balance balls in front of you. Praying that patient does not appear today.

 * Tic-tac-tic-tacâ€¦

- You've met all of the patients by approximately two o'clock in the afternoon. Jennifer does not appear to be arriving today. Thinking about this makes me feel relieved, and you swiftly pack your belongings.

- You run desperately, and the woman behind you does the same. You plead for help the entire route, but the road appears desolate. You quickly get your phone from your jacket pocket, but there is no signal around here.

 * You fled to a neighboring commercial center in a hurry.
 
- You flee to the nearest commercial center. However, the center was deserted, and all of the stores were shuttered. You knocked on every shop's door, but no one replied no matter how hard you banged.

- Since you are not feeling well today, you called the clinic and asked for a day off to adjust your mood and recollect yourself.

- You clutched your forehead, a necklace loomed in your mind, as if Jennifer had left it on the sofa.

- You get out of bed, stroll over to the desk, and get Jennifer's jewelry from the drawer. You recalled that Jennifer mentioned yesterday that she has a son who is in an orphanage.

* [Investigation]

- You find Jennifer's profile on one of the shelves. You quickly flip through the profile and notice that the name of her child is Justin, and he is currently at the largest orphanage in this city, "Windows of Hope Orphanage".

- You choose to take a look into her child.

* [Windows of Hope Orphanage] -> inside_orphanage


=== inside_orphanage
- Since you have done a study and research with your team at Windows of Hope Orphanage, you have had a lot of communication with the orphanage director. So you contacted the orphanage director, who was eager to assist me in resolving the issue.

- Orphanage director: Hey, long time no see, Dr. Jeff, what brought you here? # CLASS: whoever

* Jeff: Long time no see. To be honest, I am looking for a kid called Justin, about 7 years old. He might be the child of one of my patients. I am here to see if there is any way to help my patient. May I see the child? # CLASS: Jeff

- You choose to take a look at the first floor.
- You enter the first floor and have a look around. Right adjacent to the building, you discovered a restaurant, classrooms, an amusement park, and even a swimming pool.
- You recall searching for information on the orphanage on the Internet. As this orphanage was created with charitable funding by affluent individuals, many of the facilities inside are pretty well done, and there is even an emergency operating room on the first floor in case a kid gets an emergency illness unexpectedly.

* [Take a look around]

- You entered the cafeteria, went to the dining table, and looked at what the kids were eating today.

* [Cafeteria Menu]

- You take a closer look at the menu, which just has a few options:

- Sandwich, milk, and a peach.

- Pizza, apple juice, and salad.

- Cheese, orange juice, and salad.

* [Leave the cafeteria]

- After seeing practically everything on the first floor, you decide to visit the second floor.

* [Second Floor] ->second_floor_orphanage

=== second_floor_orphanage

- You came to the second floor.

- As you proceed down the long hallway, you notice the playroom, the lounge, and the dormitories. The second floor appears to be a play and relaxation area for youngsters.

- On the second floor, there are even rows of computers where kids may play games or study.

- As you're walking around on the second floor. A little girl appears in front of you and walks towards you.

=== Playroom
- You enter the playroom, which is crammed with toys and appears to be in disarray.

- You noticed a little boy playing with building blocks alone in a corner, while the other children seem to be isolating him.

- Orphanage director: Justin is the child in the corner. He's not an orphan. His mother left him at the door of the orphanage. His mother comes to see him once or twice a week. I'm not sure why I haven't been here this week. # CLASS: whoever

- Looking back on what happened this week, you can see why she didn't visit her son.

* Jeff: He looks lonely in the corner. # CLASS: Jeff

- Orphanage director: In fact, most of the children are fear to play with him because he appears to have a powerful aura, which makes most of us feel oppressed. # CLASS: whoever
 
- He shook his head and continued.

- Orphanage director: Once, a child was fighting with him for a toy. Justin was mad at that child and pushed the other child down without saying any word, and smashed the other's head with the toy he grabbed. When I got to the scene, Justin was already back in the corner with his toy, and he looked calm as if nothing had happened. Therefore, most of the children are very afraid to get close to Justin.  # CLASS: whoever

- You are nervous because you see Jennifer's shadow in Justin. Perhaps this is the reason that Jennifer chose to send Justin here as a way of protection.

- While you're thinking about the relationship between Justin and Jennifer, Katherine walks to Justin's corner and plays with Justin's blocks.

- Katherine took out candy from her pocket and put it right next to Justin.

- You're wondering if you should remind the orphanage director to keep an eye on Justin in order to prevent him from committing any other violent acts.

- You arrive to Jennifer's house and knock on her door respectfully. You waited for a while and didn't receive a response.

- Then you softly twisted the doorknob and discovered that the door was not locked. Creak, the door was pushed open a little crack.

-The bedroom is completely separated into two halves, the left area has a red bed, and the left wall is also dyed red. However, you scalp was numb because there were many knife marks on the walls, and some new scratches were buried in the old scratches. It's similar to a great work of art that was created over a long time.

- However, the right space is totally white, with white walls, a white bed and comforter, and even white table and chairs, which contrasts sharply with the red area next to it. -> area_check

Dear Dr. Jeff, # CLASS: bojue

I heartily invited you to come to my homes. I also request that you arrive to my place on schedule at one o'clock in the afternoon. If you do not attend, I will surely "invite" you in person. # CLASS: bojue

Sincerely, # CLASS: bojue

=== day5_jennifer

- You showed there on time at Jennifer's house. At this time, a woman dressed formally stood in front of the door, seemingly for a long time.

- Lord Erebos: Welcome, my dearest doctor. I've been anticipating this moment for quite some time. I've prepared a modest welcoming ceremony for you down below. Despite its simplicity, I hope you enjoy it. # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: Please follow me. # CLASS: bojue

* You follow him down to the basement. You could sense a faint aroma only a few steps away.

- Lord Erebos: This way please. Oh, I also made you a wonderful little gift. # CLASS: bojue

* [Continue following]

- This never-ending staircase perplexes you. Why is the underground space so vast and frightening? You have no idea why there is such a vast underground space. He appeared to read my mind the next second.

- Lord Erebos: You may be wondering why the subterranean is so vast. Allow me to tell you a story. # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: An ancestor lived here hundreds of years ago, buying all land in the area and establishing his own murder empire. This kingdom and intelligence network were built by a top assassination family over many years, but it didn't take long for the kingdom to suffer a major mishap. # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: An ancestor lived here hundreds of years ago, buying all land in the area and establishing his own murder empire. This kingdom and intelligence network were built by a top assassination family over many years, but it didn't take long for the kingdom to suffer a major mishap. # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: The daughter of a sheriff on the ground fell in love with the oldest son in the family. Love put him in a trance, and in order to protect himself, he revealed all the secrets from the ground to the sheriff, leading the family to be slaughtered overnight. Women, children, and the senior in family were not spared and were mutilated horrifically. # CLASS: bojue

* You noticed the hatred in his eyes when he said those words.

- Lord Erebos: The lone remaining enraged patriarch recognized the traitor and gave his life to the ancient gods, who cursed the family and ensured that they would never escape their fate. # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: So you were created. # CLASS: Jeff

- He nodded.

* So how long have you been alive? # CLASS: Jeff

- Lord Erebos: Of course, I've been alive for 437 years. Whenever a member of this family dies, I am passed on to their next kid, and due to the curse, they will always have offspring. # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: That doesn't make sense. # CLASS: Jeff

- Lord Erebos: That doesn't make sense? Indeed, my existence cannot be explained by common reason, just as if there is faith, if you believe in the presence of gods, it exists, and if you do not believe, it does not exist. # CLASS: bojue

 * Jeff: Then how come you wanted to murder me before? # CLASS: Jeff

- Lord Erebos: You had already endangered my life by then. But now you're a partner who can help me the most. # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: Partner? Why partner? # CLASS: Jeff

- Lord Erebos: I'm aware of what you done in the past. Since you're a doctor, as long as you're there, I can manage this body and do anything I want. And as long as you're there, I won't even go to a psychiatric institution. # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: So, now that we've covered a lot of ground, let's look at the small gift I've prepared for you. # CLASS: bojue

* From his arms, he grabbed a pretty small mirror.

- Lord Erebos: This mirror is a small gift from me to you. Although it appears to be pointless, it can determine the shape of your heart. Come try it out. # CLASS: bojue

* [You noted that his right hand appeared to be pointing in a certain direction at this point. You sneaked a peek there and discovered a very hidden letter.]

- Jeff: I think I require some thought time. # CLASS: Jeff

* [You move towards that place as you speak, but you dare not go too fast.]

- Lord Erebos: No worries, my Dear Doctor. I'll give you 10 minutes, and because I've been talking for so long, please allow me to grab something to drink. By the way, don't even think of running away. The entire underground has been locked off, and you can't get out. # CLASS: bojue

* [Lord Erebos left]

- This is a fantastic chance for you. You rush over to the message.

* [Open the message]

- Doctor, This is Jennifer, and I've hidden this message here. The only way to get rid of him is described here, but it comes at a high price. Doctor, in order to completely free yourself of him, you must first gain his trust and enable his personality to infiltrate your body. I don't have a better solution for you right now, so I'll have to rely on your doctor. # CLASS: Jennifer

- Then there's a knife called "Paradise" beneath your feet. You need to use this knife to stab into your heart when he enters your body which can trapping him. He'll never live beyond his death in this knife! # CLASS: Jennifer

- I know the price is high, and you must exchange your life, but if you do not do so, you must find a way to wake me up and seal him. # CLASS: Jennifer

- Lord Erebos: What request? # CLASS: bojue

- Lord Erebos: What do you mean? # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: Why not you want to enter my body? I control it during the day, and you control it at night. So that we may genuinely become one is acting behind the scenes while the other is out in the open. # CLASS: Jeff

* When Lord Erebos heard what you said, he laughed.

- Lord Erebos: My dear doctor, you definitely match my hunger. I know you and I are the same! # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: So, would you want to come in? # CLASS: Jeff

- Lord Erebos: Of course, I can't wait anymore, and you may begin whenever you're ready! # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: I'm fully ready! # CLASS: Jeff

* [You witness Jennifer's body collapse instantly, and a foreign soul squeezes into your mind, giving you a searing headache, but you know, the opportunity is here!]

- You pulled the knife from your arms, the pale hue of a death scythe waiting to harvest life.

- You thrust the knife into your own heart, causing terrible agony, and the earl in your body realized this as well, roaring in pain.

- Lord Erebos: How dare you deceive me! I can, believe it or not, make your life worse than death! # CLASS: bojue

- Jeff: If only you could! # CLASS: Jeff

* [The knife in your hand emits a faint glow, and you can feel the alien spirit filling your head being drawn slowly into the knife.]

- He is no longer there, yet your life is passing you by.

- Drip, drip, drip. It's incredible because there's no blood flowing out of your wound, yet you can hear blood trickling to the ground. However, you can feel your eyelids closing and a grin forming at the corner of your mouth.

- Ah, it's over.

* [A year later]
- [A Year Later]

- A mother and a kid approached a gravestone.

- They were dressed in black and placed a bouquet of flowers in front of the gravestone, as if to say hello and farewell.

- Because of your sacrifice, the centuries-old curse has been lifted, and your soul is making its way to paradise.

- Step by step, you ascend the lengthy stairwell. Just as you were ready to enter paradise, a vortex erupted in front of your eyes, radiating a brilliant light and eventually engulfing you and you vanished.

- Lord Erebos: Did you see the doctor? This knife is known as 'Hell'. # CLASS: bojue

- He looked at the knife, placed his finger in front of his lip, and struck a quiet posture.

- Lord Erebos: Shhh, pay attention, this knife is screaming all the time. There are over 100 individuals imprisoned here, each of which I killed personally, and you, doctor, will be the next! # CLASS: bojue

* When he finished speaking, he held it out toward your direction.

- It scrapes a lot of scars no matter how successfully you dodge.

- Lord Erebos: Nooooooooo! # CLASS: bojue

* The soul in the knife flowed into this body, and all the souls within became chains, trapping the Lord Erebos in the depths of consciousness.

- You sank on the ground and drew a big breath after all of this. You had never witnessed such a fantastic spectacle before, but you did it.
