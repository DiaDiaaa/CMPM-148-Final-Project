selecting
Only two can be take off
current list count = {LIST_COUNT(test)}
* {LIST_COUNT(test) != 1} select one ->select_one
* {LIST_COUNT(test) != 1} select two ->select_two
* {LIST_COUNT(test) != 1} select three ->select_three
* {LIST_COUNT(test) == 1} going example 3 -> example_3

== select_one
    one has been select, now taking off from the list, will not appear in example 3
    ~test -= one
    *[BACK] -> example_2 

== select_two
    one has been select, now taking off from the list, will not appear in example 3
    ~test -= two
    *[BACK] -> example_2 
    
== select_three
    one has been select, now taking off from the list, will not appear in example 3
    ~test -= three
    *[BACK] -> example_2 

=== example_3

{ test !? one:
    one took off from example 2
}

{ test !? two:
    two took off from example 2
}

{ test !? three:
    three took off from example 2
